      <description>Interest Fund Fund a Project with DAI Compound Interest. You don&amp;rsquo;t give away your money only the interest of that deposit. You can think that you are giving your time. A donor can start funding one project then change to another project at any time.
You can start your week giving your interest to help some project you use, than withdraw and start funding a human rights project and by the weekend you give to DLX Meetup so we can create more fun examples.</description>
