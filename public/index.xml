      <description>Mako is the energy for modern world! We transform Mako liquid in electricity, so we can live a good modern life! Some people say that exposure to Mako can poison a person, but that&amp;rsquo;s not true, you can get same Mako as new form of free (not free) and cheap (not cheap) energy to the decentralized Corporation that we are!
How can you collect some Mako? The idea is very simple, you use the contract method paymentProxy to bypass your Ethereum payments.</description>

      <description> As define in Wikipedia World domination (also called global domination or world conquest) is a hypothetical power structure, either achieved or aspired to, in which a single political authority holds the power over all or virtually all the inhabitants of the planet Earth.
Shinra Corp is a nice place to work if you believe in decentralized power of Ethereum to control the World! </description>
